## HR_Analysis
_Using MS Azure and HDInsight. Also MS Excel 2016_

We are needing to determine why some of our employees are leaving our workplace prematurely?
Predicting who might leave before they go may allow us to intervene earlier.
We will inspect and analyze different factors which lead to employee attrition.

**Insights gained**

We did not explore in great depth and compare all the features, but there is an interesting observation during the aggregation
and visualization stage of the analysis. It is discovered that the average monthly income may be an important factor in
the attrition rate of the salespeople. The average monthly income for all salespeople is approximately $6960 as compared to the 
attrition group at $5910 and the non-attrition at $7230. The income for the attrition group is very definitely below the
average, which may influence them to look elsewhere for better remuneration. The dashboard visualization also confirms our findings
when comparing the attrition and non-attrition categories.
