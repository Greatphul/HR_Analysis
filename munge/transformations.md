## Data Transformation Process

Use Azure account, and HDInsight clusters to perform the following transformations.

**1.** Create new table called "employee-sales", and load the table "employee" into the table. Include four columns, using the appropriate schema:

    1) Attrition
    2) Department
    3) JobSatisfaction
    4) MonthlyIncome
    
  **2.** Round the MonthlyIncome to the nearest $1000.
  
  **3.** Filter to show only those in the Sales department.
  
  **4.** Sort by JobSatisfaction, in descending order.
